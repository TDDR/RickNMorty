# RickNMorty

This is my repository for the Index Dev challenge. I met most of the specifications, and would have completed them all if I had more than four days.

### How to Run

The server is deployed on Heroku so all that is needed is to build the front end. After cloning the repo, navigate to the `rick-n-morty` folder

```
cd frontend/rick-n-morty
```

Now install the dependencies
```
npm i
```

For the next step you must have Docker running locally. After Docker is running you can issue the following command
```
docker-compose up
```

Once the composition has completed you can now visit the application on `http://localhost:3000`
